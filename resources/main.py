"""
FRC 2026 shooter trajectory optimization.

This program uses the Sleipnir NLP solver to find the initial pitch and yaw for a game
piece to hit the 2026 FRC game's target given an initial velocity.

This optimization problem formulation uses direct transcription of the flight dynamics, including
air resistance.

Based on the 2022 trajectory optimization example code by Tyler Veness.
